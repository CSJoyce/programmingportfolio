### Python Group Project

A mouse controlled Python game in which the player attempts to find hidden chests in a black room while simultaneously being hunted down by monsters.  As time progresses, new monsters spawn in, and each time a chest is found a new one is spawned in a random location on the screen.  Score will be the time that they player survives.
