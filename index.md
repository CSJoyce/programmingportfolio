### Lights Game

A mouse controlled Python game in which the player attempts to find hidden chests in a black room while simultaneously being hunted down by monsters.  As time progresses, new monsters spawn in, and each time a chest is found a new chest and harder enemy is spawned in a random location on the screen.  Score will be the time that they player survives.

### 10 Hour Project

A continuation of the "Lights Game" with implementation of new in-game objects, mouse interactivity, hover/fading effects, object collision, and user input.

![game1](https://github.com/CSJoyce/Lights-Game/blob/master/sc%201.jpg)

This shows the initial game layout, with two enemies spawned in to chase the player.

![game2](https://github.com/CSJoyce/Lights-Game/blob/master/sc%202.jpg?raw=true)

This shows the screen that is shown when any of the enemies make contact with the player, and the game stops.

![game3](https://github.com/CSJoyce/Lights-Game/blob/master/sc%203.jpg?raw=true)

If you look closely next to the player's circle, you will see a faint outline of the chest. This shows the mouse hover interactivity in action, with the chest becoming more apparent on the screen as the player approaches it's location.

![game4](https://github.com/CSJoyce/Lights-Game/blob/master/sc%204.jpg?raw=true)

This shows the text that is shown when the chest is found, telling the player that the chest will now spawn in a new random location on the screen.  This also triggers the creation of a new enemy, faster than the previous ones.

![game5](https://github.com/CSJoyce/Lights-Game/blob/master/%20sc%205.jpg?raw=true)

This shows the result of reaching "level" 5, in which there are 5 enemies hunting down the player whilst they seek out the chest.
